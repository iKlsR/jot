#Usage

Run `make` and then run the app with `java -classpath lib\rsyntaxtextarea.jar;bin. Jot`

The additional scripts serve no real purpose atm unless on Windows where you can use `jot.bat` to run after compile or slap together a portable jar with `make exec`.


#Misc

I *know* what you are thinking.. another Java Text Editor.. yep. :)

Jot is not the average `JTextArea` however and even though I can't dedicate much time to it atm, I plan to make this evolve into something useful eventually.

It is still very, very and I still cannot stress enough, *very* experimental. Around **v0.0.4** I will start to shape it up.
Alot of it so far has just been hacked together. Currently, it is very limited in functionality, most of what is present is constant and there is no way yet to change it,
the syntax, theme, font etc. All will be addressed in due time.

Jot makes use of the excellent [RSyntaxTextArea](http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/) for highlighting amongst other things, these will be listed in detail soon.
It is under `/lib` along with its LICENSE.
